  Author: Casey E Gilbert

  This project is a mockup of a data visualization installation. It is a processing sketch thgives the user a GUI with a time window. As they adjust the time window, the ropes change their length to reflect the portion of the graph the user wants to see. It is a test for the algorithm that will control the real life installation.
